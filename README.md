# Airtel Money Integration for Java

## Introduction
This is a java library to ease integration of the Airtel Money API into Java applications. 
The complexities of the whole API are simplified into easily usable methods.

**Note:** The library is still in developemnt so I can't guarantee stability.

### Technologies used sofar

- Spring WebFlux for API integration
- JUnit for testing
- [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) to avoid writing boilerplate code

Currently you can be able to request Access tokens from the Airtel API and make a collection request with the obtained access token.
Still setting up things like transaction inquiry, refunds, disbursement, a batch of refactoring plus tests of course.

**Since the library is still in development, I will update the readme as we go and I will finally release it as a dependency**
